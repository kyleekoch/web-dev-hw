I went to a site for Obama from 2004.  It looks very old and outdated to me, something that if I were to click on it now I would not think that it is a legit website as it is so outdated.

I have already used to git module and it has always been a little bit confusing for me to make sure that everything gets transferred over there and pushed to the repository.
