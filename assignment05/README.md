The head can have the following elements in it:
<title>,<style>,<base>,<link>,<meta>,<script>,<noscript>
The body on the other hand can have many elements within it.  It contains all of the contents of the HTML in it, whereas the head contains all of the meta elements which are the contents of the document.



Structural markup is used to give information about the structure of a document, and can also change the appearance of a document.  It includes information about titles, paragraphs, sections, etc.  Semantic markup is HTML that gives meaning to the web page, rather than just presentation.



For this homework assignment I had to first find a recipe that I wanted to put on my page.  Next I started to set my html document up by adding the 4 main document types.  After I did that I went over the requirements for this assignment and went to the course website to understand how to so the things that I did not have any knowledge on.  I went through and first did the headings, then the meta elements, the lists, and then lastly the semantic markups.  I also had to add an email, address, and picture of my recipe.
