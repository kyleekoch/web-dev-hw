I have seen forms like signing up for their promotion emails, signing up for their rewards memberships, keaving comments or concerns for the business, etc.  I think these are good for helping to promote business and to make the viewers feel engaged.

For this assignment I first thought about a brick and mortar that I really enjoy, which is Betty's Divine in Missoula.  After that I read through the lesson plan and went to the course website and read through and got familiar with all of that information.  Next I started coding and started with the things that I already knew how to do to get that out of the way.  I then went in and created the table and stylized it.  Next, I started in on the forms, which at first really confused me but after carefully reading through the course site and looking at the examples I figured out kind of how to do it.  I did all of the different types of forms and inputs we were required to.  Lastly, I submitted it to github and made sure that my link worked and all of the information needed was present, and then I submitted it to moodle.
