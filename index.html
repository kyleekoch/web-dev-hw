   <<h1>
     For Girls Filled with Fire

   </h1>>
   <p>
     Girl, you were born with a fire inside you and this world is determined to stamp it out.
     <hr />
     You will see it when you stand up for yourself, and you are told 'It isn't ladylike to raise your voice.'
     <hr />
     You will hear it when you wear something that hugs your body and feel the uncomfortable sensation of being stripped naked by the eyes of the men who call you names you are still too young to understand.
     <hr />
     You will know it when a man tries to use his strength to have his way with you the first time, and you need to use your fists/teeth/legs to get him off.
     <hr />
     You will understand it when you see your mother's eyes filled with terror because you are an hour later than you said you will be home.
     <hr />
     But you must neverlet them take those flames from within your soul, Instead you must burn brighter than ever because you are a Daughter of the Sun, and you belong only to yourself, not to this world.
