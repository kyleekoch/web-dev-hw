 # Assignment 2
 ## Kylee Koch

  I chose to take this class because it is required for my major in media arts.
  I also have already taken a class in web design when I attended school and Montana State University,
  but that was two years ago and I have not retained much of the information that I learned in that class,
  so I am hoping to relearn how to make websites.  When I graduate I want to have a good
  understanding when it comes to web design as I think that will help me out a ton in my future jobs.

 1. I have learned how to manage Github
 2. I have learned how to start coding on Atom
 3. I have learned how to link pictures on to Atom
