      How to Acrylic Pour Paint
    </h1>
    <h2>
    <b>  Materials</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Acrylic Paints</li>
        <li>Pouring Medium of your choice</li>
        <li>Craft Sticks</li>
        <li>Plastic cups</li>
        <li>Heat Gun</li>
        <li>Drop mat</li>
        <li>Pan or container to put it in (make sure edges are high)</li>
        <li>Prop to hold up painting</li>
        <li>Gloves</li>
        <li>Silicone Spray (optional)</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>
      <b>Directions</b>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prepare work area. Cover table and floor with plastic tarps. Set out plastic cups for pouring paint. Place your canvas or wood propped up in the pan or tray. Add the paints you want to each cup and add the pouring medium until it has the consistency you want.</li>
        <li>Spray a few sprays of silicone spray into the colors of your choice. You can choose one color or all. The more colors you add it to the more cells it will produce once the heat is added.</li>
        <li>Once paints are mixed as you want you can pour them all into one cup. This is called a “dirty pour”. <em>(You can also add them separately if you want, pouring on one and then the next in the way you want. This would probably be a better choice for larger paintings)</em></li>
        <li>Once the paints are all in the cup, you will quickly flip the cup onto the canvas. Or you can put the canvas on top of the cup and, holding it securely, flip it over. The suction will keep the cup in place until you pull it off.</li>
        <li>Pull the cup of and the paint will flow all over the canvas. Let it flow and feel free to tip or roll the canvas around to get the paint where you want it.</li>
        <li>Once you have it as you want it, use the heat gun to pop some of the air bubbles trapped in the paint <em>(this creates the cells)</em></li>
        <li>Let dry for a long time. How long depends on how much paint you used and how big the painting is, but most drying times are <em>2-7 days</em></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
