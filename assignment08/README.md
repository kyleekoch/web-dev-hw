Learning HTML was definitely challenging for me.  I previously took a web design course about 2 years ago and I retained none of that information, so this was basically like relearning how to do it for me.  I really struggle with the images part of it, but I am working on figuring that out.  I do not remember ever learning how to enter tables and forms into my previous documents, so that was fun for me to learn.  I overall have it enjoyed it so far, it is challenging and I am going to have to practice, but overall I think it is really fun.

CSS is the part of web design I actually remember doing, because it is the part that interests me most.  I am an art major, so anything that has to do with designing is right up my alley.  I am excited to further my knowledge on the CSS portion and to learn how to make a visually pleasing website.

For this cycle I read through the lesson plan and went to the course website to learn about what we were going to do.  This portion was basically combing everything that we have learned thus far and combining it into one, so I did a lot of reviewing.  I found a project that I wanted to do and a good website explaining all of the steps and then went from there.  I built my html with the basics and then went in and added the extras to get all of the information that I needed to do.  Lastly, I linked all of the pages together so they became one site, then I submitted it to Github.
