    <b>My Instructable Choice</b>
  </h1>

  <p>
    I chose this instructable because it is actually something that I love doing.<br>  I find pour painting to be very fun because no painting ever comes out the same as the last. <br> It is a fun way to express myself and it is very easy to do.  I also like to create these paintings because it is an easy way to liven up a room and add a pop of color.<br>  If you want to learn more I recommend looking up tutorials on youtube, that is where I learned to do it,<br> and also the instructions that I provided give a great explanation for getting started.
